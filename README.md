### Notes on the Open Threat Exchange API

- OTX reports on and receives threat data in the form of _pulses_.

- a _pulse_ consists of 1+ indicator of compromise (IOC) that constitute a threat or sequence of actions that could be used to carry out attacks on network devices/computers. 

- _pulses_ also provide information on the reliability of the threat info, who reported the threat, and other details of threat investigations

- OTX provides the 'DirectConnect SDK' for Python:
